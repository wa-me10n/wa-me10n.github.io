1. Testing and Validation of New Systems or Applications:

How is the lifecycle of new IT systems and applications managed within the organization, from development to deployment? What specific testing methodologies (e.g., unit testing, integration testing, system testing) are employed before moving systems to the live production environment?

What mechanisms are in place to ensure that each stage of testing—especially functional and security testing—is documented comprehensively? Is there an independent audit trail for the test results, and how is this maintained over time?

How does the organization handle changes to existing systems? Are there predefined triggers for regression testing when modifications are introduced, and how are the potential impacts on legacy systems evaluated?


2. Security and Resilience of IT Systems:

Describe how security controls are embedded into the IT systems of the organization. What formal security testing practices, such as penetration testing or vulnerability assessments, are in place to ensure that critical security controls are functioning effectively before the system is deployed?

How does the organization’s testing framework evaluate the system’s resilience to potential cyber-attacks, and what stress testing is done to simulate attack scenarios such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) or data breaches?

How is the integrity of system functions validated under various load conditions? What specific load or volume tests are conducted to measure system performance, and how do you ensure the system continues to function efficiently under stress?


3. Environment Replication for Testing:

In what ways does the testing environment mirror the production environment? Is there a formal process in place to replicate all hardware, software, network configurations, and database states in the testing environment to avoid false positives or negatives during testing?

What safeguards are implemented to ensure that the testing environment does not introduce any disruptions to the production systems, particularly in shared infrastructure? How frequently is the testing environment updated to remain consistent with the live environment?


4. Traceability Matrix and Test Coverage:

How does the organization use a traceability matrix to ensure that all business and technical requirements are thoroughly tested before deployment? What tools or processes are used to map specific test cases to functional and non-functional requirements?

How does the organization measure the depth and coverage of test cases? Are automated testing tools employed to increase the breadth of tests, and how do you ensure that critical business logic, system performance, and integration points are comprehensively covered?


5. Automated Testing Practices:

What percentage of your testing processes is automated, and how do you determine which test cases are suitable for automation? What framework or tools (e.g., Selenium, JUnit) are used for automating testing processes, and how are they integrated into the continuous development and deployment pipelines?

How is the quality and accuracy of automated tests ensured? Are there fail-safes or manual reviews built into the process to validate the results of automated tests, particularly when dealing with highly sensitive financial transactions?


6. Third-Party Systems and Software Code Review:

What due diligence process is followed for third-party systems or software components before they are integrated into your organization's IT infrastructure? How do you ensure that third-party applications are subject to the same rigorous testing standards as internally developed systems?

What policies govern the ongoing monitoring and testing of third-party systems after they have been deployed? How is the organization protected from risks associated with software vulnerabilities, licensing issues, or interoperability failures of third-party components?


7. Code Integrity and API Testing:

How do you ensure that core code components and any newly introduced code are functioning as expected, without generating unintended consequences? Is there a formal process for reviewing code quality (e.g., through code walkthroughs or peer reviews) before it is pushed into production?

What practices are in place for testing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to ensure seamless communication between systems? How do you verify that APIs meet security standards and do not expose the organization to vulnerabilities such as insecure endpoints or data leaks?


8. Handling of Defects and Software Bugs:

How are software bugs or defects identified during testing managed within the organization? Is there a centralized system for tracking and prioritizing defect resolution, and how do you ensure that critical defects are addressed before the system goes live?

For critical or high-impact defects, what escalation processes are in place to report these issues to senior management or SCOT? How do you ensure that defects are remediated in a timely manner without introducing additional risks to the production environment?


9. User Acceptance Testing (UAT):

What is the organization’s process for conducting User Acceptance Testing (UAT)? How are end-users involved in validating that the system meets business needs, and what criteria must be met before UAT is signed off?

How are the results of UAT documented and integrated into the overall test report? How does the organization ensure that any issues raised during UAT are tracked, addressed, and resolved before final deployment?


10. Non-Functional Testing (Volume, Stress, Resilience, etc.):

How often does the organization conduct non-functional testing, and what parameters are tested during each session? For example, how do you evaluate the system’s ability to scale under increased volumes or resist stress conditions (e.g., during high trading activity or market volatility)?

What methodologies are used to assess the system’s resilience and recovery capabilities in case of failure? Is there a formal process for testing the effectiveness of disaster recovery (DR) and business continuity planning (BCP) measures?


11. White Box (Structural) Testing:

How does the organization implement white box testing to evaluate internal system architectures, including data flow, control flow, and exception handling? Are there specific tools used to analyze the system at a structural level, and how do you ensure that any potential vulnerabilities are addressed?

What measures are in place to validate the security and effectiveness of error and exception handling mechanisms? How does the system react to unforeseen inputs or unusual operating conditions, and how is this tested in a controlled manner?


12. Governance and Reporting Mechanisms:

How is the organization’s IT testing framework governed and monitored by senior leadership or relevant committees? What role does the Standing Committee on Technology (SCOT) play in overseeing testing activities, and how are test results communicated to them?

How does the organization ensure that any regulatory changes or recommendations from SEBI (or equivalent bodies) are incorporated into the testing framework? Is there a structured review process to adapt testing methodologies in response to evolving market conditions or technology advancements?


13. Auditing and Compliance:

How is the IT testing framework audited to ensure compliance with SEBI’s directives and industry best practices? How frequently are internal and external audits conducted, and what specific areas do auditors focus on when assessing the adequacy of testing practices?

How does the organization address any audit findings or recommendations related to the IT systems? Is there a formal process to implement corrective actions, and how are these actions tracked to completion?


14. Continuous Improvement and Learning:

What feedback loops or post-mortem reviews are conducted after each major testing cycle or deployment? How does the organization use these learnings to improve future testing practices and ensure the continual refinement of the IT systems?

How does the organization ensure that its testing practices evolve in line with emerging technologies (e.g., cloud computing, blockchain) and market requirements? What continuous learning or upskilling programs are in place for the IT teams to stay updated on best practices in testing and security?
