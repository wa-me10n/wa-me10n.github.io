Network Administration

1. Redundancy:

What redundancy measures are in place for critical network components (routers, switches, firewalls)?

Are backup network paths tested periodically to ensure failover functionality?

In the event of a network component failure, how quickly can the redundant systems take over?



2. Monitoring:

Is network traffic being continuously monitored for abnormal patterns or potential security breaches?

What tools are used for real-time network monitoring (e.g., Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Network Performance Monitors)?

How are security alerts prioritized and escalated for response?



3. Breakdown Resolution:

What is the average time taken to identify and resolve network breakdowns?

Are there established procedures for diagnosing and resolving network outages?

How is post-incident analysis performed to prevent recurrence of the same issue?





---

WAN Management

4. Connectivity Provisions for Business Continuity:

What WAN connectivity solutions are in place to ensure business continuity during outages (e.g., MPLS, VPN, leased lines)?

Is there an established and tested process for switching to backup WAN services during primary WAN failure?

How often are disaster recovery and business continuity plans (related to WAN connectivity) tested in real-world scenarios?





---

Encryption

5. Router-Based Encryption:

Are all routers configured to support encryption for sensitive traffic?

What encryption protocols are employed at the router level (e.g., IPSec, SSL/TLS)?

Is the encryption configuration regularly audited to ensure compliance with best practices?



6. Data Transmission Encryption:

Are all data transmissions, particularly over public or untrusted networks, encrypted using strong encryption algorithms?

How is encryption managed for data transfers between different branches or over third-party networks?

Are end-to-end encryption standards in place to secure sensitive financial data during transit?





---

Connection Permissions

7. Restriction on a Need-to-Have Basis:

Are all network access permissions granted based on the principle of least privilege?

How are user and device access permissions reviewed periodically for continued relevance?

What process is followed to revoke access rights when they are no longer needed or authorized?





---

Fallback Mechanism

8. Dial-Up Connections and Other Backup Mechanisms:

Are fallback mechanisms like dial-up connections or other alternative connectivity tested periodically?

What security controls are in place to protect against unauthorized access during fallback situations?

How quickly can fallback mechanisms be deployed in the event of primary network failure?





---

Hardware-Based Signing Process

9. Signing Process:

Are hardware-based digital signing processes in place for critical transactions or communications?

How is the integrity of the hardware signing devices (e.g., HSMs) ensured and monitored?

What procedures exist to handle device failure or compromise in the signing process?





---

Incidents of Access Violations

10. Access Violations & Corrective Actions:

Have any network access violations been reported in the previous audit or monitoring cycle?

What corrective actions were taken in response to access violations or policy breaches?

How are repeated violations mitigated to ensure they do not recur?





---

Additional Controls

11. Other Network/Communication Controls:

Are there any other network security controls deemed necessary beyond the listed items (e.g., micro-segmentation, firewall rules)?

How often are network controls reviewed and updated to reflect emerging threats and vulnerabilities?

Are all network controls aligned with applicable regulations, industry best practices, and internal security policies?





---

General Data Communication/Network Security Posture

12. Regular Audits:

How often are external and internal audits conducted to assess the adequacy of network controls?

Are audit findings and recommendations acted upon in a timely manner?

What is the process for continuous improvement of network and data communication controls based on audit outcomes?
