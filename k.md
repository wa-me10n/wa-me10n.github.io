All companies, data centers, government organizations, and service providers need to set their computer clocks using the time provided by either the National Informatics Centre (NIC) or the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). They can also use other clocks that are directly linked to NIC or NPL for this purpose. If they have offices in different locations and use a different time source, it must match the time from NIC or NPL exactly.

Checks to be Performed Against the SEBI Circular Timelines

1. Coordination Among Entities (SCSBs, Stock Exchanges, Depositories, Intermediaries, NPCI, and Sponsor Bank)

Check: Confirm that a well-defined coordination mechanism is in place among all the involved entities (SCSBs, stock exchanges, depositories, intermediaries, NPCI, and Sponsor Bank) to ensure the listing and commencement of trading are completed within T+6 working days.

Verify: Review documented coordination plans or agreements that outline the roles, responsibilities, and timelines for each entity in the process.

Ask for a walkthrough: Request a step-by-step overview of the coordination process, detailing how each party contributes to meeting the T+6 timeline.



2. Modification of Bid Details by Stock Exchanges (T+1 Day)

Check: Verify that stock exchanges allow modification of only specific fields in the bid details and that this modification is restricted to occur only until 01:00 PM on T+1 day.

Verify: Review system logs or transaction records from the stock exchange to ensure that no modifications to the bid details are made after 01:00 PM on T+1 day.

Ask for a walkthrough: Inquire how the stock exchange's modification process is managed, including which fields can be modified, how access is controlled, and what measures are in place to prevent changes after the deadline.



3. Acceptance of Applications by SCSBs (T+1 Day)

Check: Ensure that designated branches of SCSBs do not accept applications and schedules after T+1 day.

Verify: Obtain and review logs from the SCSBs showing the timestamps for all accepted applications to confirm that no schedules or applications were processed after T+1 day.

Ask for a walkthrough: Request an explanation of the SCSBs' application acceptance process, focusing on the cutoff mechanism used to enforce the T+1 deadline.



4. Registrar's Submission of Bid File to SCSBs (T+1 Day)

Check: Confirm that the registrar provides the bid file, received from the stock exchanges, to all the SCSBs by T+1 day. This file should contain the application numbers and amounts for use in validation/reconciliation.

Verify: Examine communication records or system logs to confirm that the registrar submits the bid file to SCSBs within the stipulated T+1 day timeline.

Ask for a walkthrough: Request a demonstration of the file submission process, including details on the format of the bid file, how it is securely transmitted to SCSBs, and what verification steps are taken to ensure successful receipt.



5. Validation and Reconciliation by SCSBs

Check: Ensure that SCSBs use the bid file provided by the registrar for their internal validation and reconciliation.

Verify: Review the reconciliation procedures at the SCSBs to check if they involve cross-verifying the application numbers and amounts with those in the registrar's bid file.

Ask for a walkthrough: Request a detailed explanation of the SCSBs' validation and reconciliation processes, including how discrepancies (if any) are handled and resolved.



6. Completion Within T+6 Working Days

Check: Verify that the entire process, from issue closure to the listing and commencement of trading, is completed within the stipulated T+6 working days.

Verify: Review recent transaction records or timelines for the listing of non-convertible securities, municipal debt securities, and securitized debt instruments to ensure compliance with the T+6 working day requirement.

Ask for a walkthrough: Inquire about the procedures in place for tracking and monitoring progress to meet the T+6 timeline, and how potential delays are identified and managed.



These checks ensure that a financial organization complies with the SEBI circular's guidelines for the timely processing and listing of securities.
