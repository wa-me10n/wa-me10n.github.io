**Sub-topic A: Public Accessibility of Cloud Instances**

1. **Are any cloud servers or storage buckets publicly accessible without authorization?**

   *Note:* The auditor will examine cloud configurations to identify servers and storage buckets that are publicly accessible without proper authentication. This involves checking security groups, network access control lists (ACLs), and bucket policies to ensure unauthorized users cannot access sensitive data.

2. **Have all cloud storage buckets been reviewed for public access permissions?**

   *Note:* The auditor will review the access control settings of all cloud storage buckets. They will verify that buckets are not unintentionally set to public and that appropriate permissions are in place to restrict access to authorized personnel only.

3. **Is there any sensitive data stored in cloud instances that can be accessed publicly?**

   *Note:* The auditor will scan cloud storage for sensitive data exposure. They will use tools to detect publicly accessible data and assess whether encryption and access controls are properly implemented to protect such data.

4. **Are security group rules configured to prevent unintended public access?**

   *Note:* The auditor will inspect security group configurations to ensure that only necessary ports and protocols are open to the internet. They will check for overly permissive rules that could allow unauthorized access to cloud instances.

5. **Have default settings of cloud services been modified to enhance security?**

   *Note:* The auditor will verify that default configurations, which might allow public access, have been adjusted according to best practices. This includes reviewing default user accounts, firewall settings, and service configurations.

**Sub-topic B: Security of Cloud Access Tokens**

1. **Are cloud access tokens securely stored and not exposed in code repositories?**

   *Note:* The auditor will search code repositories for any instances where cloud access tokens might have been accidentally committed. They will ensure that tokens are stored in secure locations, like encrypted vaults, and not hard-coded into applications.

2. **Have any cloud access tokens been exposed in website source code or configuration files?**

   *Note:* The auditor will analyze website source code and configuration files for embedded tokens. They will use automated scanning tools to detect any secrets that should be kept confidential.

3. **Are there policies in place to prevent the public exposure of access tokens?**

   *Note:* The auditor will review organizational policies regarding credential management. They will assess the effectiveness of procedures like code reviews and the use of secret management tools to prevent token exposure.

4. **Is multi-factor authentication enabled for accessing cloud management interfaces?**

   *Note:* The auditor will check that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all users accessing cloud services. MFA adds an extra layer of security in case access tokens are compromised.

5. **Are cloud access tokens rotated regularly to mitigate security risks?**

   *Note:* The auditor will evaluate the token lifecycle management practices. Regular rotation of tokens reduces the window of opportunity for malicious actors if a token is leaked.

**Sub-topic C: Security Measures for Testing, Staging, and Backup Environments**

1. **Are testing, staging, and backup environments properly secured and segregated from the production environment?**

   *Note:* The auditor will assess network segmentation and access controls to ensure that non-production environments are isolated from production. They will verify that data flow between these environments is controlled and monitored.

2. **Is sensitive data in testing or staging environments appropriately masked or anonymized?**

   *Note:* The auditor will check whether production data used in testing environments is anonymized to protect sensitive information. They will review data handling procedures and masking techniques.

3. **Have obsolete or unused testing environments been decommissioned?**

   *Note:* The auditor will identify any old or unused environments and verify that they have been properly disabled or removed. This reduces the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities.

4. **Are backup environments on the cloud secured with appropriate access controls and encryption?**

   *Note:* The auditor will examine backup storage configurations to ensure that data is encrypted both at rest and in transit. They will also check access permissions to verify that only authorized personnel can access backups.

5. **Are security policies consistently applied across production, testing, and staging environments?**

   *Note:* The auditor will compare security policies across all environments to ensure consistent application of security measures. This includes checking for disparities in patch management, access controls, and monitoring.

**Sub-topic D: Employment of Hybrid Data Security Tools**

1. **Has the organization implemented hybrid data security tools suitable for cloud environments?**

   *Note:* The auditor will evaluate the data security tools in use to ensure they are capable of operating in both on-premises and cloud environments. They will assess tools for features like data encryption, DLP, and unified management.

2. **Are the data security tools configured to align with the cloud's shared responsibility model?**

   *Note:* The auditor will review the configurations of security tools to ensure they cover the organization's responsibilities in the cloud, such as protecting data and managing user access.

3. **Do the security tools provide visibility and control over data across hybrid environments?**

   *Note:* The auditor will verify that the organization has tools that offer comprehensive monitoring and control over data, regardless of where it resides, to detect and respond to security incidents effectively.

4. **Is there regular assessment of the effectiveness of hybrid data security tools?**

   *Note:* The auditor will check for periodic evaluations or audits of the security tools to ensure they are functioning as intended and adapting to new threats or changes in the environment.

5. **Are best practices followed for data encryption and key management in cloud-based environments?**

   *Note:* The auditor will examine encryption practices, including how encryption keys are managed and stored. They will ensure that keys are secured, rotated regularly, and that encryption standards meet industry best practices.
