B. Contractual Terms for Audit and Information Access

1. Check if the agreement with the CSP explicitly includes provisions for audit and information access rights for the financial organization and SEBI.


2. Verify that the agreement allows the organization to conduct due diligence and supervisory reviews without any hindrance.


3. Assess if the contract terms ensure that the organization's ability to manage risks, provide supervision, and comply with regulatory requirements is not compromised.


4. Ask for documentation or a walkthrough of how the organization plans to exercise these audit and information access rights in practice.



C. Legal and Technical Vetting of the Agreement

E. Audit and Vulnerability Assessment

1. Confirm that the agreement holds the CSP responsible for conducting audits and vulnerability assessments (VAPT) of the services/components managed by the CSP.


2. Check if the agreement specifies that the organization is responsible for auditing services/components it manages, including requirements for scope, duration, and closure of vulnerabilities as per SEBI regulations.


3. Verify whether an implementation and configuration audit is to be conducted by the organization before going live on the cloud, with all non-compliances resolved.


4. Review if the organization considers reports or certificates from CSP audits conducted by STQC but also ensures compliance with SEBI regulations through additional audits when required.


5. Ensure the contract includes clauses that enforce the CSP to adhere to these audit/VAPT requirements, including service level agreement (SLA) terms.


6. Ask for documentation or a process outline that describes how these audits are monitored and enforced.



F. Contract Termination and Exit Strategies

3. Check if there are provisions ensuring that the minimum retention requirements for data are met according to SEBI and government regulations.


4. Review procedures in place to archive necessary data and logs even if the organization moves out of the cloud or changes CSPs.



H. Data Accessibility and Usability

1. Verify if the agreement ensures that the organization's data, including logs and business data, is stored in an accessible, legible, and usable manner during the use of cloud services and after exiting the cloud.


2. Check if there are clauses that ensure the financial organization can provide data to SEBI or other government agencies upon request.

I. Adherence to SEBI Circulars

1. Confirm that the agreement includes clauses that require adherence to SEBI circulars and guidelines issued from time to time.
