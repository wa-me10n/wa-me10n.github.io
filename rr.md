Here’s the revised version of the questions, starting with "Check" or "Verify" to guide a structured audit or security review:

Network Administration

1. Redundancy:

Check if redundancy measures are in place for critical network components (routers, switches, firewalls).

Verify whether backup network paths are tested regularly to ensure they can take over during a failure.

Check if there is a documented process for switching to redundant systems during a network failure.



2. Monitoring:

Verify if the network is being continuously monitored for abnormal traffic patterns or security breaches.

Check if appropriate monitoring tools (e.g., IDS, NPM) are deployed and functioning effectively.

Verify how alerts are categorized and escalated, and if response times are within acceptable limits.



3. Breakdown Resolution:

Check if there are defined procedures for identifying and resolving network outages quickly.

Verify the average time to resolve network breakdowns and whether it meets the organization's Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

Check if post-incident analysis is conducted after breakdowns to prevent future occurrences.

WAN Management

4. Connectivity Provisions for Business Continuity:

Check if WAN connectivity solutions (e.g., MPLS, VPN) are in place to ensure business continuity.

Verify whether backup WAN services are tested periodically to ensure functionality.

Check if business continuity and disaster recovery plans related to WAN management are regularly updated and tested.





---

Encryption

5. Router-Based Encryption:

Verify if all routers are configured to support strong encryption protocols (e.g., IPSec, SSL/TLS).

Check if router-based encryption configurations are reviewed periodically for compliance with best practices.

Verify if the encryption keys are securely managed and rotated regularly.



6. Data Transmission Encryption:

Check if all sensitive data transmitted over public or untrusted networks is encrypted.

Verify whether encryption protocols (e.g., TLS, AES) are appropriately configured for data in transit.

Check if encryption standards align with organizational and regulatory requirements for data transmission.





---

Connection Permissions

7. Restriction on a Need-to-Have Basis:

Verify if network access permissions are granted on a "need-to-have" basis, following the principle of least privilege.

Check if there is a process in place for regularly reviewing user and device permissions.

Verify if access rights are revoked immediately when no longer needed or authorized.





---

Fallback Mechanism

8. Dial-Up Connections and Other Backup Mechanisms:

Check if fallback mechanisms, such as dial-up connections or alternative backup links, are tested regularly.

Verify if security controls, such as authentication and encryption, are in place for fallback connections.

Check the speed and efficiency of deploying fallback mechanisms in case of primary network failure.





---

Hardware-Based Signing Process

9. Signing Process:

Verify if a hardware-based digital signing process is implemented for critical transactions.

Check if the integrity and security of hardware signing devices (e.g., HSMs) are regularly monitored.

Verify if there are procedures in place to handle failures or compromises in the hardware signing process.





---

Incidents of Access Violations

10. Access Violations & Corrective Actions:

Verify if any access violations have been recorded in the last audit or security report.

Check if corrective actions have been taken to address any access violations or security policy breaches.

Verify if repeat violations are being actively mitigated and prevented.





---

Additional Controls

11. Other Network/Communication Controls:

Check if additional network controls, such as micro-segmentation or firewall configurations, are in place and functioning effectively.

Verify if network controls are regularly updated to reflect new security threats and vulnerabilities.

Check if network controls are aligned with regulatory requirements and industry best practices.





---

General Data Communication/Network Security Posture

12. Regular Audits:

Verify if internal and external audits of network security are conducted on a regular basis.

Check if audit findings are addressed promptly and corrective measures are taken as recommended.

Verify if there is a continuous improvement process in place for network security based on audit results.




These checks will help ensure that the organization’s network and data communication systems are secure, compliant, and resilient.
